## Fermi_Problems
 
This source code is for a website I created called Fermi Problems. It is a portal to subscribe to an email list for uniquely generated fermi problems to be sent to you. It was built using NodeJS for the server and NodeEmailer and OpenAI API for email and text generation functionality.

If you would like to download the source code and host it yourself, you will need to clone the repository and generate your own OpenAI API and gmail account keys. 

This source code was designed by Blake Seigler.
